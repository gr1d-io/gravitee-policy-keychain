== Description

This policy intercepts the API requests on Gravitee API Gateway for retrieving the necessary credentials from the Keychain service for authenticating with partner services (that are behind the gateway).

== Usage

Given that the credentials are already registered on the Keychain service, there is no action needed besides inserting this policy into the required API operations.
